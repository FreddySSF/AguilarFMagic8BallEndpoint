# AguilarFMagic8BallEndpoint

// Opening the file AguilarFMagic8BallEndpoint in vs code, turn on the debug feture and let it run. Once it has finished running the
// localhost page will show up and say it can't be found. Return to the debug console in vs sharp and copy + paste the http url ( example: http://localhost:5250 ).
// Open up Postman in your web browser and create a new http request. Paste the http into the request. You type in / and then the name of the controller
// including what goes in after the route in parenthesis. With another dash you input the value you wish for {randomize}.
// Enter send and the url should output into postman a randomized response {randomize} like a magic 8 ball would! Try asking a question and hitting send!

// Peer Reviewed By: Manuel L. When looking and the code evertything looks good so I went to postman to make sure everything works even better and it does
// the code throws out different endings which is the point of magic eight ball overall everything looks really great and so does the code,
// Great job on the assignment :)
